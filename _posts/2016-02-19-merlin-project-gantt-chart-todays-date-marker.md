How to show today's date in your Merlin Gantt chart

As a common, default feature in Microsoft Project; I was surprised to find this feature hidden in Merlin's project settings. Here's how to activate it in your Merlin Project plan. 

First of all, click on the timeline in the Gantt view:

This will bring up the Time Scale settings in the Inspector on the right of the window. From here, simply check the box labelled "Time Line". You'll see the time line appear in your gantt. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ca055bb2-f1da-40c6-9c4a-e301935b84d4.png)

Personally I feel that the time line's default colour is a little hard to see, so I altered it's appearance. To do this, right click on the time line itself and select _Style Time Line._

You can then change the colour to whatever you like:
